# Intro to my project

This is a test to see if it can help me with work. Right now I am working on a handrail picked layout. Enter a number and get basically a spreadsheet of all the lengths where each picket needs to get placed. I plan to add other things like stairs and roofs once I get a feel of the layout.

As of now this is very generic but with time I hope to add options for varying designs. Work in Progress.

### Notes

- set up a function to eventual class to handle foot, inch and fraction input. Right now it only handle straight numbers. For the most part that is fine but future projects will need this.
- right now it only handles one way of doing pickets. Where there is a picket at each end. With post you may want to save a couple and start up to 4" away. So eventually I would like to add that option.
- I want to eventually make this all into classes as this project grows

### Bugs to address

If I press the button more then once it doesn't clear. I am using ol instead of ul in html which is nice but with it double printing the number just keeps growing.
