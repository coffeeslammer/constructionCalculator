# Intro to Construction Calculator Project

This is a test to see if it can help me with work. Right now I am working on a handrail picked layout. Enter a number and get basically a spreadsheet of all the lengths where each picket needs to get placed. I plan to add other things like stairs and roofs once I get a feel of the layout.

As of now this is very generic but with time I hope to add options for varying designs. Work in Progress.

### Notes

My biggest challenge I am having is getting a proper foundation going so when I add more choices it doesn't become a complete and total mess. I don't know how many times I have taken and completely redid what I have coded with testing and learning. Trials and errors.

#### Issues (github)in no certain order

- imperial to metric conversion and back
- Major overhaul of CSS (probably multi issue there)
- stairs has check box and radio but they are dummy filler so make them work
- figure a way to have the options in a usable and readable way
- get the roof section going(which is a ton of options(issues) there to add)
- a lot more to add here

### Optimizations

My goal is to keep adding different math issues I come up with at work and/or any I think would be of use in construction
I would like to be able to convert from imperial to metric so some of what I have could be used in other countries though I have no idea of code limits or any of that which is also why I would like to add options to change set numbers. example would be for stairs I can not go over 7.75 in rise but maybe there would be a place where that doesn't matter.

### Bugs to address

- the code

### Updates

- once code is stable I will start adding here

### Notes for me,TODO, FIXME and BUG I have in my code

This is for my use while coding. I have wrote and deleted quite a bit.
